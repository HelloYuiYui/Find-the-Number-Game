# Find-the-Number-Game
Finds a random number.

This game is my first Python project (after "Hello World"). I have done a flow chart first and fit it into Python via Visual Studio.

HOW TO PLAY

it asks you that which numbers you want to guess between first.
you should choose a number between these numbers (you can choose every number actually.

Thanks.
